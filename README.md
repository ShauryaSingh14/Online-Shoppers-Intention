# Online Shoppers Intention Predictor 
## The Aims is to predict whether or not a website visitor is likely to make a purchase on an e-commerce website based on their browsing behavior.
- This is a binary classification problem, where the model must predict whether the visitor will make a purchase or not.

- The project involves using dataset[ðŸ”—](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammishra08/MachineLearning/master/Datasets/Online%20Shoppers%20Intention.csv) that contains various features such as the number of pages visited, the duration of the session, and the type of operating system used. 
- The KNN algorithm is used to build the model, which works by identifying the k-nearest neighbors to a given data point and classifying it based on the majority class of those neighbors.

- The end result of the project is a model that can be used by e-commerce websites to predict the likelihood of a visitor making a purchase based on their browsing behavior. This information can be used to target specific visitors with personalized offers or improve the website experience to increase the likelihood of a purchase.
