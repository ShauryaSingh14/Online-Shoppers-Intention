# Online-Shoppers-Intention
Online Shoppers Intention predictor aims to predict whether or not a website visitor is likely to make a purchase on an e-commerce website based on their browsing behavior. This is a binary classification problem, where the model must predict whether the visitor will make a purchase or not.

The project involves using a dataset ![ðŸ”—](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammishra08/MachineLearning/master/Datasets/Online%20Shoppers%20Intention.csv) that contains various features such as the number of pages visited, the duration of the session, and the type of operating system used. The KNN algorithm is used to build the model, which works by identifying the k-nearest neighbors to a given data point and classifying it based on the majority class of those neighbors.

To build the model, the dataset is first preprocessed and cleaned to remove any missing or irrelevant data. Then, the data is split into training and testing sets, and the KNN algorithm is applied to the training set to create the model. The accuracy of the model is then evaluated on the testing set, and adjustments can be made to improve the performance of the model.

The end result of the project is a model that can be used by e-commerce websites to predict the likelihood of a visitor making a purchase based on their browsing behavior. This information can be used to target specific visitors with personalized offers or improve the website experience to increase the likelihood of a purchase.
